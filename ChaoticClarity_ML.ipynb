The setting of industrial units involving wide spread use of machinery, changes in working and living environment of workers, concentration of industries in large towns have brought the workers together to maintain and improve their bargaining power and hence their employment conditions. The first organized Trade Unions in India named as the Madras Labour Union was formed as early as 1918. Since then, a large number of Unions came up in almost all the industrial centers of the country.

The Rules Framed under the “Trade Unions Act,1926 impose obligation on the registered Trade Unions (Workers & Employers) to submit annual statutory retum in the prescribed format to the Registrar of their respective States/ Union Territories.
